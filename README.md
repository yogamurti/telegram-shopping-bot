# telegram-shopping-bot

## Overview
The code for RooRooBot, a Telegram bot that acts as our shopping list assistant. It currently only adds, removes and lists items in a shopping list. However, we will add web scraping functionalities to automatically retrieve the desired item, from a desired supermarket, when we specify a generic item to add to our shopping list. It will also calculate the estimate costs once this is implemented. 

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yogamurti/telegram-shopping-bot.git
cd telegram-shopping-bot
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Please also contact the project maintainers to obtain the .env file, which contains the Telegram Bot Key. The .env file should be placed in the telegram-shopping-bot directory.

## Usage

To run the server, which enables the telegram bot to function, run:
```bash
python bot.py
```
